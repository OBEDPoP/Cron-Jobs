ron jobs are used for automation, maintenance, monitoring, and security. System admins commonly schedule tasks like backups, log cleanup, security scans, and service restarts. Using crontab -e, admins define jobs with specific schedules. Debugging cron issues involves checking logs and testing commands manually.
